NOTE: `order_amt` means "order amount"

## Part A

For each store show the % difference in sales between 2014 and 2015

### Example answer


```sql
select 
    store_id, 
    100 * case (sum(2015_sales) as decimal) - sum(2014_sales) / sum(2014_sales)
from
(
    select 
        store_id, 
        case 
        when extract (year from order_date) = '2014' 
        then sales_amt else 0 end as 2014_sales,
        case 
        when extract (year from order_date) = '2015' 
        then sales_amt else 0 end as 2015_sales
    from orders
) as t1
group by store_id;
```

## Part B

For each store show the % of all customers that have purchases at least 1 product

```sql
WITH cust_orders AS (
    select 
        cust_id, 
        case 
            when o.cust_id IS NULL
            then 0 
            else c.cust_id 
        end as cust_ordered
    from customers c 
    left join orders o on c.cust_id = o.cust_id;
)
select count(distinct cust_ordered) / count(distinct cust_id) * 100


```

## Part C

List all the customers that live in a state, ordered by the number of unique products they bought.

```sql
select * from customers c
left join orders o on c.cust_id = o.cust_id
left join product p on o.prod_id = p.prod_id
where state='UT'
order by count(distinct product_id) desc;
```

## Part D

Find the earliest born and last born customers, by gender, who have bought at least 1 product.


```sql
SELECT
    gender, 
    max(dob), 
    min(dob)
FROM customers 
JOIN orders o on c.cust_id = o.cust_id
WHERE dob IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY gender;
```

## Part E

Get top 3 orders for top 3 customers who have ordered product x but not y


```sql
SELECT cust_id
from(
    select 
        cust_id, 
        prod_id, 
        order_amt,
        count(distinct prod_id) over(partition by cust_id) as cnt, 
        row_number() 
            OVER (PARTITION by cust_id order by order_amt desc) 
            AS rn
    from customers c join orders o
    on c.cust_id = o.cust_id
    where o.prod_id in ('X','Y')
) 
where 
cnt=1 and prod_id='X'
and rn<=3;
```
